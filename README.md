# Bikeshare-Analysis_poc
The Dataset in this folder is from a bike rental business obtained from kaggle. Trying to analyse the data and gain insights using Machine Learning Techniques.

In the script, we will analyze the various aspects of the dataset and try to 
predict the dependent variable with the help of independent variables

Predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour i.e we are interested 
in predicting count, which represents the total number of bikes rented in the
period of that hour.
